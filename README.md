# Pump It Up: Data Mining the Water Table

This repository contains my analysis and predictive modeling project, focusing on water pump functionality in Tanzania. The goal is to build a model that predicts the operational status of water pumps, helping identify issues and improve water access in rural areas.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes water point data to determine the functionality of water pumps across Tanzania. Using advanced data analytics and machine learning, I developed a model to predict whether a pump is functional, functional but needs repair, or non-functional.

## Key Highlights

### Data
- **Training Set Values**: `Training set values.csv`
- **Training Set Labels**: `Training set labels.csv`
- **Test Set Values**: `Test set values.csv`
- Features include geographic location, pump type, construction year, water quality, and other metadata.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and imputed missing values.
   - Encoded categorical features.
   - Scaled numerical data for modeling.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identified trends and relationships between features and pump functionality.
   - Visualized key insights through charts and graphs.
3. **Model Development**:
   - Built classification models including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.
   - Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

### Results
- The best-performing model achieved high accuracy in predicting pump functionality.
- Key features influencing functionality include installation year, water quality, and region.

## ðŸ›  Next Steps
1. Deploy the model as a web app to provide real-time predictions.
2. Conduct further feature engineering for improved accuracy.
3. Expand analysis to include additional regions or datasets.
